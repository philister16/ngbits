# Ngbits

This project contains a number of small libraries useful in everday Angular development. More libraries may be added over time. However, the goal is not develop it into yet another feature complete components library but instead add additional features rarely found in frontend libraries out of the box.

## Getting started

To use the library install it from NPM.

`npm install --save ngbits`

Please visit the [Docs](https://philister16.github.io/ngbits/) for a more detailed usage description.

## Development server

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.6.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

# Ngbits

Small bits of Angular for everyday use. This project contains a number of small libraries with more to be added over time. It is not yet another feature complete components library but instead aims to add additional features rarely found in frontend libraries out of the box.

## Getting started

Visit the [Docs](https://philister16.github.io/ngbits) for more detailed usage instructions.

Install the package:

`npm install --save @ngbits/ngbits`

Each individual ngbit feature consists of a separate module. Import the respective feature's module and add it to the imports array of a module in your application. For example to use the Flash feature do the following:

```typescript
import { NgbitFlashModule } from '@ngbits/ngbits';

@NgModule({
    // ... module declarations etc.
    imports: [
    NgbitFlashModule
    ],
    // ... rest of module
})
export class AppModule { }
```

> Take note that the package name is in plural `@ngbits/ngbits` whereas the individual features use the singular form like `Ngbit[SomeFeature]Module)`.

### Optional

The library comes with a number of default stylings which make use of the popular [Bootstrap CSS](https://getbootstrap.com) framework. For these to work, you need to also install and import boostrap.

`npm install --save bootstrap`

```scss
// styles.scss
@import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap`;
```
